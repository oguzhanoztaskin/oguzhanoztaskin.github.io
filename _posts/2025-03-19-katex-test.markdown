Introduction
============

This document contains my notes and understanding of cryptographic
concepts.

Mathematical Foundations
========================

Modular Arithmetic
------------------

Euler's theorem states that: 

$$a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod n$$

 where
$$\phi(n)$$ is the Euler totient function.

Elliptic Curves
---------------

An elliptic curve over a field $$\mathbb{F}_p$$ is defined by:


$$y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$$



Test $$\phi$$ and 

$$123$$



Zero-Knowledge Proofs
=====================

A zero-knowledge proof allows one party to prove knowledge of a secret
without revealing it.
